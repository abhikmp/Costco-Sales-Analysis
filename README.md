## üîç Process

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Conducted EDA using Python and Pandas to understand data patterns.
- Identified inconsistencies, such as extra spaces and non-uniform column names.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Integration and Cleaning

- **Connected to Multiple Data Sources**: Integrated PostgreSQL, Excel, and CSV files.
- **Used Power Query**: Performed data cleaning, transformation, and merging for seamless integration.
- **Handled Missing Data**: Removed rows with null values in critical fields (e.g., unit price, quantity).
- **Resolved Duplicates**: Ensured data integrity by addressing duplicate records.
- Ensured consistent units for analysis by normalizing data metrics.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Data Modeling

- **Established Relationships**: Built relationships between tables for unified modeling (star schema).
- **Merged Data**: Combined COGS and product data using Power Query to calculate profits.
- **Incorporated Discounts**: Factored in discount percentages and quantities for precise metrics.

### Ô∏è4Ô∏è‚É£ Dashboard Design

- **Intuitive Layout**: Organized visuals into logical sections, allowing quick navigation and clarity.
- **Dynamic Filters**: Included slicers for year, region, and product category to enable flexible analysis.
- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: Displayed metrics like total revenue, profit margin, and YoY growth prominently for instant insights.
- **Interactive Charts**: Added bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to highlight trends and patterns effectively.
- **Drillthrough Options**: Implemented drillthrough buttons for detailed exploration of specific products or regions.
- **Custom Tooltips**: Designed tooltips for charts to provide additional context and data points upon hover.
- **Color-Coded Metrics**: Used a consistent color scheme to differentiate between profit, loss, and other critical indicators.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced Calculations

- Developed multiple DAX measures: Revenue, profit, and profit margin.
- Target sales based on last month's performance.
- YoY growth and sales trends.
